    <h1>Letter Dorms</h1>
    <h3>Lodge-Style Residence Halls</h3>
    <p>TThe Lee & Bob Peterson Residence Hall, Ulla R. Searing Residence Hall, and the V and Y residence halls are lodge-style structures that feature studio,
        two- and three-bedroom apartments, each with its own kitchenette and bathroom. The halls feature a dramatic two-story floor plan with central common areas, timbered ceilings, 
        and a keyless entry system. These side-by-side residence halls are sometimes called “Letter Dorms” because they were originally designated as V, W, X, and Y Dorms before two were officially named. 
        The apartment bedroom sizes are approximately 12′ x 9′.</p>
