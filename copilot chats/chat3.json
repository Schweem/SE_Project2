          "value": "Sure, I can help with that. However, I'll need to know what programming language and framework you're using to serve your views. If you're using Django, you would typically add the `weeks` list to your context in your view function, like this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nimport calendar\n\ndef calendar_view(request):\n    # Get the current year and month\n    year = datetime.now().year\n    month = datetime.now().month\n\n    # Create a calendar object\n    cal = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)\n\n    # Create the weeks list\n    weeks = []\n    for week in cal:\n        week_days = []\n        for day in week:\n            if day == 0:  # day outside of the month\n                week_days.append(None)\n            else:\n                # Fetch events from your database here\n                events = Event.objects.filter(date=datetime(year, month, day))\n                week_days.append({\n                    'day': day,\n                    'events': events\n                })\n        weeks.append(week_days)\n\n    # Render the template with the weeks list\n    return render(request, 'calendar.html', {'weeks': weeks})\n```\n\nThis code assumes that you have a Django model named `Event` with a `date` field. It fetches all events for each day of the current month and adds them to the `weeks` list. The `weeks` list is then passed to the template context, so you can use it in your template as shown in the previous example.\n\nPlease replace `Event` and `date` with your actual model and field names. Also, you might need to adjust the code to fit your application's needs.",

The `weeks` list is structured as described in the previous examples. The 'day' and 'week' cases are left unchanged.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that your `Event` model has a `date` field that is a `date` object, not a `datetime` object. If your `date` field is a `datetime` object, you'll need to adjust the filter condition to match events for the entire day.",

This error is likely occurring because the `value` being passed to `parse_datetime` is not a string.\n\nThis could be happening for a few reasons:\n\n1. The data in your database might not be formatted correctly. The `DateTimeField` expects a string in a specific format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS), and if the data in your database doesn't match this format, you might get this error.\n\n2. The data you're trying to save to your `DateTimeField` might not be a string. If you're trying to save a `datetime` object or some other type of data to this field, you might get this error.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to ensure that the data you're saving to your `DateTimeField` is a string in the correct format. If the data is coming from a form, you might need to modify the form to ensure it's sending the data in the correct format. If the data is coming from your database, you might need to modify your database to ensure the data is stored in the correct format.",
