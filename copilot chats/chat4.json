          "value": "To add the ability to pick specific days in a todo list, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add a date field to your todo item model. This field will store the date when the todo item is due.\n2. Update your todo item creation form to include a date picker. This will allow users to select the due date for the todo item.\n3. Update your todo list view to sort or filter todo items by their due date. This will allow users to view todo items for a specific day.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might implement this in JavaScript using a simple array as your data store and the built-in Date object for date handling:\n\n```javascript\n// Step 1: Add a date field to your todo item model\nclass TodoItem {\n  constructor(task, dueDate) {\n    this.task = task;\n    this.dueDate = dueDate;\n  }\n}\n\n// Your todo list\nlet todoList = [];\n\n// Step 2: Update your todo item creation to include a date\nfunction addTodoItem(task, dueDate) {\n  const item = new TodoItem(task, new Date(dueDate));\n  todoList.push(item);\n}\n\n// Step 3: Update your todo list view to sort or filter by date\nfunction getTodosForDate(date) {\n  const targetDate = new Date(date);\n  return todoList.filter(item => item.dueDate.toDateString() === targetDate.toDateString());\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `addTodoItem` is used to add a new todo item with a specific due date to the list, and `getTodosForDate` is used to retrieve all todo items due for a specific date. The dates are compared using `toDateString` to ignore time differences. \n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include any UI elements. Depending on your application, you might be using a different way to store your data (like a database) and a library or framework to handle your UI (like React or Angular). The general idea will be the same, but the specifics will depend on your exact setup.",

The `::after` pseudo-element creates a virtual element that is the last child of the `tr` element. This pseudo-element is positioned at the vertical middle of the `tr` (`top: 50%`) and spans its entire width (`width: 100%`). The `border-top` property creates a line that crosses out the `tr`.\n\nPlease note that the color and thickness of the line can be adjusted by changing the `red` color and `2px` thickness in the `border-top` property.",

The `completed=False` argument filters out completed events, and the `date__gte=now.date()` argument filters out events before today. The `order_by('date', 'time')` method is used to sort the remaining events by date and time.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that your `Event` model has a `completed` boolean field that indicates whether an event is completed or not. If your model uses a different field or a different way to indicate completion, you'll need to adjust the `completed=False` argument accordingly.",

Then, in your Django template, you can use the `{% if %}` tag to apply this class to completed tasks.\n\nHere's how you can update your CSS and Django template:\n\n```css\n.completed {\n    text-decoration: line-through;\n}\n```\n\n```django-html\n{% for event in day.events %}\n<div class=\"event {% if event.completed %}completed{% endif %}\">\n    <h3>{{ event.title }}</h3>\n    <p>{{ event.description }}</p>\n    {% if event.url %}\n    <p><a href=\"{{ event.url }}\">Link</a></p>\n    {% endif %}                    \n    <p>Time: {{ event.time }}</p>\n</div>\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nIn this updated CSS, the `.completed` class uses the `text-decoration: line-through;` property to draw a line through the text.\n\nIn the updated Django template, the `{% if event.completed %}completed{% endif %}` tag checks if `event.completed` is true. If it is, the `completed` class is added to the `div` element, which causes the text in the `div` to be crossed out.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that your `Event` model has a `completed` boolean field that indicates whether an event is completed or not. If your model uses a different field or a different way to indicate completion, you'll need to adjust the `{% if event.completed %}completed{% endif %}` tag accordingly.",

You'll need to create a URL pattern for the event's page and a corresponding view function.\n\nHere's how you can update your Django template:\n\n```django-html\n{% for event in day.events %}\n<a href=\"{% url 'event_detail' event.id %}\">\n    <div class=\"event {% if event.completed %}completed{% endif %}\">\n        <h3>{{ event.title }}</h3>\n        <p>{{ event.description }}</p>\n        {% if event.url %}\n        <p><a href=\"{{ event.url }}\">Link</a></p>\n        {% endif %}                    \n        <p>Time: {{ event.time }}</p>\n    </div>\n</a>\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nIn this updated template, the `{% url 'event_detail' event.id %}` tag generates a URL for the event's page. The `'event_detail'` argument is the name of the URL pattern for the event's page, and the `event.id` argument is the ID of the event, which is passed to the URL pattern as a parameter.\n\nHere's how you can add the URL pattern to your `urls.py` file:\n\n```python\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom . import views\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    # Other URL patterns...\n    path('event/<int:event_id>/', views.event_detail, name='event_detail'),\n]\n```\n\nIn this URL pattern, `'event/<int:event_id>/'` is the pattern for the URL. The `<int:event_id>` part is a path converter that matches an integer and passes it to the view function as a parameter named `event_id`.\n\nHere's how you can create the `event_detail` view function:\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render\nfrom .models import Event\n\ndef event_detail(request, event_id):\n    event = get_object_or_404(Event, pk=event_id)\n    return render(request, 'event_detail.html', {'event': event})\n```\n\nIn this view function, the `get_object_or_404(Event, pk=event_id)` function gets the `Event` object with the primary key `event_id`, or raises a 404 error if no such object exists. The `render(request, 'event_detail.html', {'event': event})` function renders the `event_detail.html` template with the `event` context variable.",

When the `div` is clicked, it navigates to the URL generated by the `{% url 'event_detail' event.id %}` tag. The `style=\"cursor: pointer;\"` attribute changes the cursor to a pointer when it's over the `div`, which indicates that the `div` is clickable.\n\nThe `style=\"color: inherit;\"` attribute in the `<a>` tag makes the link text inherit the color of its parent element, which overrides the default blue color for links.",

This should ensure that the styles are applied correctly. \n\nRemember to include this CSS in your HTML file, either by linking to a CSS file with a `<link>` tag, or by including the CSS in a `<style>` block. If it still doesn't work, there might be other CSS rules that are overriding these, or the HTML structure might be different than expected.",

          "value": "Yes, there are several reasons why the underline might not be disappearing:\n\n1. **CSS Specificity**: If there's another CSS rule that has higher specificity and sets `text-decoration` to `underline`, it will override the rule you've set. \n\n2. **CSS Inheritance**: If the parent element of the link has `text-decoration` set to `underline`, the link might inherit this property.\n\n3. **External CSS**: If there's an external CSS file that's loaded after your internal CSS, and it has rules that affect your links, those rules will take precedence.\n\n4. **Browser default styles**: Browsers have default styles for certain elements. If these aren't being overridden correctly, they might be causing the issue.\n\nLooking at your code, it seems like the `a` tag is nested inside the `div` with class `event`. This could be causing the issue because the `onclick` event on the `div` might be interfering with the `a` tag's default behavior. \n\nTry moving the `a` tag outside of the `div` like this:\n\n```django-html\n{% for event in day.events %}\n<a href=\"{% url 'event_detail' event.id %}\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: inherit;\">\n    <div class=\"event {% if event.completed %}completed{% endif %}\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">\n        <h3>{{ event.title }}</h3>\n        {% if event.url %}\n        <p><a href=\"{{ event.url }}\" style=\"color: inherit; text-decoration: none;\">Link</a></p>\n        {% endif %}                    \n        <p>Time: {{ event.time }}</p>\n    </div>\n</a>\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nThis way, the entire `div` becomes clickable due to the surrounding `a` tag, and the `text-decoration: none;` style should remove the underline from the link.",

The `style=\"position: absolute; bottom: 0;\"` attribute in the `form` tag positions the form at the bottom of the `div`.\n\nThe `btn-yeti` class applies the Yeti button styles. You'll need to define this class in your CSS:\n\n```css\n.btn-yeti {\n    /* Yeti button styles... */\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that you have the Yeti button styles defined in your CSS. If you don't, you'll need to add them. Also, remember to include this CSS in your HTML file, either by linking to a CSS file with a `<link>` tag, or by including the CSS in a `<style>` block.",

          "value": "Yes, you can achieve this by passing an extra parameter in the URL when you call the `mark_todo_completed` view from the event detail page. This parameter can be used to determine where to redirect after marking the todo as completed. Here's how you can update your view:\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\n\ndef mark_todo_completed(request, todo_id, from_event_detail=False):\n    todo = get_object_or_404(Event, id=todo_id)\n    todo.completed = True\n    todo.save()\n    if from_event_detail:\n        return HttpResponseRedirect(request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER', '/'))\n    else:\n        return redirect('todo_list')\n```\n\nIn this updated view, the `from_event_detail` parameter determines whether the view was called from the event detail page. If `from_event_detail` is `True`, the view redirects to the previous page. The previous page's URL is obtained from `request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER', '/')`, which gets the URL of the page that referred the request to the current page. If the referrer is not available, it redirects to the home page (`'/'`).\n\nPlease note that you'll need to update the URLs that call this view to include the `from_event_detail` parameter. For example, if you're calling this view with a `{% url %}` tag in a Django template, you'll need to update it to `{% url 'mark_todo_completed' todo.id True %}` when calling from the event detail page, and `{% url 'mark_todo_completed' todo.id False %}` otherwise.",
